One statistical technique for binary classification problems is logistic regression. It makes predictions about a binary outcome's probability using one or more predictor factors. It determines the likelihood that an event will occur and uses a logistic function to transfer that likelihood into the interval [0,1].

In several disciplines, including biology, marketing, and economics, logistic regression is frequently utilized to forecast outcomes like a patient's propensity for a particular illness or a customer's propensity to purchase a product. It is a type of regression analysis that is widely used for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in predicting binary outcomes. 
Usually, odds ratios or probability values are used to interpret the results of logistic regression. The following are some typical interpretations of a logistic regression analysis's findings:

1. Coefficients: In logistic regression, the coefficients show how the log-odds of the outcome are affected by a one-unit change in the predictor variable. A positive coefficient means that the log-odds of the result rise when the predictor variable increases, whereas a negative coefficient means the opposite.

2. Odds ratios: The coefficients of logistic regression models can be used to compute odds ratios. When the predictor variable is present, the odds of the result are increased; conversely, when the odds ratio is less than 1, it suggests 
Logistic regression uses odds, which are a concept from probability theory, to calculate the probability that an event will occur. To put it simply, odds are the ratio of the likelihood that an event will occur to the likelihood that it won't.

In mathematics, the probability of an occurrence (often represented by "p") can be computed as follows: \Odds(p) are equal to \frac{p}{1-p}.

The log-odds (logit) of the outcome probability are modeled in logistic regression as a linear function of the predictor variables:
\[{frac{p}{1-p})/ln = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_nx_n +... + \]

where the likelihood of the event happening is represented by: - \(p \).
- \(x_1, x_2,..., x_n \) are the variables that predict.
The coefficients corresponding to the predictor variables are \(\beta_0, \beta_1,..., \beta_n \).
