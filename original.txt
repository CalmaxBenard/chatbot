Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It calculates the odds of the probability of an event happening and applies a logistic function to map this into the range of [0,1].

Logistic regression is commonly used in various fields such as economics, marketing, and biology for predicting outcomes such as whether a customer will buy a product or whether a patient has a certain disease. It is a type of regression analysis that is widely used for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in predicting binary outcomes. 
The results of logistic regression are typically interpreted in terms of odds ratios or probability values. Here are some common ways to interpret the results of a logistic regression analysis:

1. Coefficients: In logistic regression, the coefficients represent the effect of a one-unit change in the predictor variable on the log-odds of the outcome. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the predictor variable leads to an increase in the log-odds of the outcome, while a negative coefficient indicates the opposite.

2. Odds ratios: Odds ratios can be calculated from the coefficients of logistic regression models. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the presence of the predictor variable increases the odds of the outcome, while an odds ratio less than 1 indicates a decrease in the odds.

3. Probability values: Logistic regression also provides probability values, which represent the predicted probability of the outcome occurring given the values of the predictor variables. These probabilities can be used to make decisions or classify observations based on a specific threshold.

4. Confidence intervals: Confidence intervals for the coefficients or odds ratios can help assess the uncertainty in the estimates. Wider confidence intervals indicate greater uncertainty in the estimation of the effect of predictor variables on the outcome.

Overall, interpreting the results of logistic regression involves understanding the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome, using coefficients, odds ratios, and probability values to make predictions or draw conclusions about the relationship between variables. 
The concept of odds in logistic regression is derived from probability theory and is used to measure the likelihood of an event occurring. In simple terms, odds represent the ratio of the probability of an event happening to the probability of it not happening.

Mathematically, the odds of an event occurring (often denoted as "p") can be calculated as:
\[ Odds(p) = \frac{p}{1-p} \]

In logistic regression, we model the log-odds (logit) of the probability of the outcome as a linear function of the predictor variables:
\[ ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n \]

where:
- \( p \) is the probability of the event occurring.
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the predictor variables.
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n \) are the coefficients associated with the predictor variables.

By taking the exponential of both sides of the equation, we can estimate the odds of the event occurring:
\[ Odds(p) = e^{(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n)} \]

The logistic function is then applied to convert the log-odds into probabilities between 0 and 1:
\[ p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}} \]

In summary, the math intuition behind the odds in logistic regression involves modeling the log-odds of the probability as a linear function of the predictor variables, and then applying the logistic function to convert the log-odds into probabilities. This allows us to predict the likelihood of an event occurring based on the values of the predictor variables.
